_**Strength of Bone.**_ A bone swarm can choose to deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, and adds 1.5x its Strength bonus on swarm damage rolls as bits and pieces of broke skeletons claw, bite, and slam at the victom.
_**Swarm.**_ The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a human skull. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points. 

## Actions
_**Multiattack.**_ The bone swarm can attack every hostile creature in its space with swirling bones.
_**Swirling Bones.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. _Hit:_ 31 (5d8 + 9) bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (includes Strength of Bone special ability).
_**Death's Embrace (Recharge 5-6).**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. _Hit:_ the target is grappled (escape DC 16) and enveloped within the swarm's bones. While the creature is grappled, the swarm can direct the creature's movement on the creature's turn, or at any other time the creature would be allowed to move. Any non-area attack against the bone swarm has a 50% chance of hitting a creature grappled in Death's Embrace instead.
