<h2>Actions</h2>
<hr class="thin">
<p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Multiattack.</span> Juiblex makes three acid lash attacks.</p><p class="stat-line">
    <span class="stat-title">Acid Lash.</span>
    <span class="attack-type">Melee Weapon Attack:</span>
    +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
    <span class="hit-text">Hit: </span>
    21 (4d6 + 7) acid damage. Any creature killed by this attack is drawn into Juiblex's body, and the corpse is obliterated after 1 minute.
</p>
<p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Eject Slime (Recharge 5-6).</span> Juiblex spews out a corrosive slime, targeting one creature that it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 55 (10d10) acid damage. Unless the target avoids taking any of this damage, any metal armor worn by the target takes a permanent −1 penalty to the AC it offers, and any metal weapon it is carrying or wearing takes a permanent −1 penalty to damage rolls. The penalty worsens each time a target is subjected to this effect. If the penalty on an object drops to −5, the object is destroyed.</p>

<h2>Legendary Actions</h2>
<hr class="thin">
<p class="stat-line">Juiblex can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Juiblex regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Acid Splash.</span> Juiblex casts acid splash.</p><p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Attack.</span> Juiblex makes one acid lash attack.</p><p class="stat-line">

    <span class="hit-text">Hit: </span>
    21 (4d6 + 7) poison damage, and the target is slimed. Until the slime is scraped off with an action, the target is poisoned, and any creature, other than an ooze, is poisoned while within 10 feet of the target.
</p>


<h2>Juiblex's Lair</h2>
<hr class="thin">
<p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Lair Actions.</span> </p><p class="stat-line">On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Juiblex can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects: he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:<br />• Juiblex slimes a square area of ground it can see within the lair. The area can be up to 10 feet on a side. The slime lasts for 1 hour or until it is burned away with fire. When the slime appears, each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or become restrained. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, that creature must make the same save. A restrained creature is stuck as long as it remains in the slimy area or until it breaks free. The restrained creature, or another creature who can reach it, can use its action to try to break free and must succeed on a DC 21 Strength check. If the slime is set on fire, it burns away after 1 round. Any creature that starts its turn in the burning slime takes 22 (4d10) fire damage.<br />• Juiblex slimes a square area of ground it can see within the lair. The area can be up to 10 feet on a side. The slime lasts for 1 hour or until it is burned away with fire. When the slime appears, each creature on it must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and slide 10 feet in a random direction determined by a d8 roll. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, that creature must make the same save. If the slime is set on fire, it burns away after 1 round. Any creature that starts its turn in the burning slime takes 22 (4d10) fire damage.<br />• A green slime (see the Dungeon Master's Guide) appears on a spot on the ceiling that Juiblex chooses within the lair. The slime disintegrates after 1 hour.</p>
<p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Regional Effects.</span> </p><p class="stat-line">The region containing Juiblex's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:<br />• Small bodies of water, such as ponds or wells, within 1 mile of the lair turn highly acidic, corroding any object that touches them.<br />• Surfaces within 6 miles of the lair are frequently covered by a thin film of slime, which is slick and sticks to anything that touches it.<br />• If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Juiblex table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.<br />If Juiblex dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
<p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Regional Effect: Madness of Juiblex.</span> If a creature goes mad in Juiblex's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Juiblex table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more on madness.<br />Madness of Juiblex<br />d100 | Flaw (lasts until cured)<br />01–20 | "I must consume everything I can!"<br />21–40 | "I refuse to part with any of my possessions."<br />41–60 | "I'll do everything I can to get others to eat and drink beyond their normal limits."<br />61–80 | "I must possess as many material goods as I can."<br />81–00 | "My personality is irrelevant. I am defined by what I consume."</p>

<p class="stat-line">Juiblex. Called the Faceless Lord and the Oozing Hunger in ancient grimoires, Juiblex is demon lord of slime and ooze, a noxious creature that doesn't care about the plots and schemes of others of its kind. It exists only to consume, digesting and transforming living matter into more of itself.<br />A true horror, Juiblex is a mass of bubbling slime, swirling black and green, with glaring red eyes floating and shifting within it. It can rise up like a 20-foot hill, lashing out with dripping pseudopods to drag victims into its bulk. Those consumed by Juiblex are obliterated.<br />Only the truly insane worship Juiblex and tend to its slimes and oozes. Those who offer themselves up to the demon lord are engulfed by it and become vaguely humanoid, sentient oozes. The bodies of these former flesh-and-blood creatures form Juiblex's extended physical body, while the demon lord slowly digests and savors their identities over time.<br />Juiblex's Lair<br />Juiblex's principal lair is known as the Slime Pits, a realm which Juiblex shares with Zuggtmoy. This layer of the Abyss, which is also known as Shedaklah, is a bubbling morass of oozing, fetid sludge. Its landscape is covered in vast expanses of caustic and unintelligent slimes, and strange organic forms rise from the oceans of molds and oozes at Juiblex's command.<br />Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 151, Out of the Abyss p. 243</p>
