Instead, the damage creates cracks in its carapace, revealing its hearts. Tromokratis has four hearts: two on its chest, one on its back, and one at the base of its tail. A heart has an AC of 22 and 100 hit points. It is immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and it is immune to all conditions. If it is forced to make a saving throw, treat its ability scores as 10 (+0). If it finishes a short or long rest, the carapace heals, any destroyed hearts regenerate, and the hearts are covered again. Tromokratis dies when all the hearts are destroyed.</p><p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</span> If Tromokratis fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p><p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Magic Weapons.</span> Tromokratis's weapon attacks are magical.</p><p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Siege Monster.</span> Tromokratis deals double damage to objects and structures.</p><p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Spell-Resistant Carapace.</span> Tromokratis has advantage on saving throws against spells, and any creature that makes a spell attack against Tromokratis has disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<hr class="thin">
<p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Multiattack.</span> Tromokratis makes three attacks: one with its pincer, one with its tail, and one with its tentacle grasp.</p><p class="stat-line">
    <span class="stat-title">Pincer.</span>
    <span class="attack-type">Melee Weapon Attack:</span>
    +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.
    <span class="hit-text">Hit: </span>
    20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 26). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, and Tromokratis can't use this attack on anyone else.
</p>
<p class="stat-line">
    <span class="stat-title">Tail.</span>
    <span class="attack-type">Melee Weapon Attack:</span>
    +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.
    <span class="hit-text">Hit: </span>
    23 (3d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a creature, it is knocked prone.
</p>
<p class="stat-line">
    <span class="stat-title">Tentacle Grasp.</span>
    <span class="attack-type">Melee Weapon Attack:</span>
    +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature.
    <span class="hit-text">Hit: </span>
    20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 26). If the target doesn't escape by the end of its next turn, Tromokratis throws the target up to 60 feet in a straight line. The target lands prone and takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage.
</p>
<p class="stat-line">
    <span class="stat-title">Bite.</span>
    <span class="attack-type">Melee Weapon Attack:</span>
    +18 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
    <span class="hit-text">Hit: </span>
    29 (3d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by Tromokratis, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside Tromokratis, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of Tromokratis's turns. If Tromokratis takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, Tromokratis must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of Tromokratis. If Tromokratis dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.
</p>


<h2>Legendary Actions</h2>
<hr class="thin">
<p class="stat-line">Tromokratis can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Tromokratis regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Move.</span> Tromokratis moves up to half its speed.</p><p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Tail.</span> Tromokratis makes one tail attack.</p><p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Bite (Costs 3 Actions).</span> Tromokratis makes one bite attack.</p>
<h2>Mythic Actions</h2>
<hr class="thin">
<p class="stat-line">If Tromokratis's mythic trait is active, it can use the options below as legendary actions for 1 hour after using Hearts of the Kraken.</p>
<p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Rampage.</span> Tromokratis makes two attacks: one with its tail and one with its tentacle grasp.</p><p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Coral Growth (Costs 2 Actions).</span> Each creature within 10 feet of Tromokratis must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Until the start of its next turn, Tromokratis and its hearts gain a +2 bonus to AC.</p><p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Tromokratis as a Mythic Encounter.</span> Tromokratis numbers among the most powerful creatures a group of adventurers might face. If you wish to make an encounter with the kraken truly legendary, Tromokratis might use its Hearts of the Kraken mythic trait. When this happens, it calls upon a reserve of strength just as it appears to be vanquished. After its hearts are exposed, Tromokratis can choose one of its mythic actions when it uses a legendary action.<br />Read or paraphrase the following text when Tromokratis uses its Hearts of the Kraken trait:<br />------<br />The titanic monster's carapace cracks, revealing a pulsing, red-purple heart buried amid heaps of blubber and muscle. Fissures run across the beast's ancient shell, revealing three other mighty, ichor-slick organs. The sea terror thrashes, channeling pain into fury.<br />------<br />Fighting Tromokratis as a mythic encounter is equivalent to taking on two CR 26 creatures in one encounter. Award a party 180,000 XP for defeating Tromokratis after it uses Hearts of the Kraken.</p>

<hr>
<p class="stat-line">Most krakens roam the seas, shattering hulls and scattering fleets, but the kraken Tromokratis notoriously vents its wrath on coastal settlements. Whether it acts at the command of the god Thassa or to sate its own hunger, Tromokratis numbers among the most feared threats in the sea, having no fixed lair and wandering where it will. In recent memory, the massive menace rose from the waves to topple the Pyrgnos, Meletis's great repository of scholarly knowledge. Since that day, the polis keeps a watch specifically for Tromokratis.<br />Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros p. 254</p>
