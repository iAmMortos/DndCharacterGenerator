<p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Ambusher.</span> The ooze has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.</p><p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Amorphous.</span> The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.</p><p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Corrosive Form.</span> A creature that touches the ooze or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) acid damage.
Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the ooze is coated in a corrosive red slime. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed.
Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage. The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round.</p><p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">False Appearance.</span> While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a pile of rubies.</p><p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Spider Climb.</span> The ooze can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>

</p>
<p class="stat-line"><span class="stat-title">Acid Spray (Recharge 5-6).</span> The ooze sprays its bright red protoplasm in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 21 (6d6) acid damage and is restrained as its flesh begins to turn into a translucent ruby -like stone. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't restrained. The restrained creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of its next turn, taking 21 (6d6) acid damage and becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success.</p>
